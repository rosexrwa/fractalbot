# Agent Routing

FractalBot selects one inbound runtime with `agents.router`. Supported values are `ohMyCode`, `codexAppCDP`, `claudeDesktop`, and `grokBotApp`. If `router` is empty, the first enabled runtime is selected in that order; if none is enabled, supported inbound messages use the legacy echo behavior.

Generic Agent Router ingress currently accepts Telegram, Feishu/Lark, Slack, Discord, and iMessage. Demail transport can receive and send messages, but Demail messages do not yet enter these Agent Routers.

## Agent selection

Send `/agent <name> <task>` (or `/to <name> <task>`) to select an allowed agent. Use `/admin <text>` to send recovery or management text to the reserved `admin` agent. Messages without an explicit selection use the active router's `defaultAgent`.

When `allowedAgents` is set, only listed names are accepted, so add `admin` before enabling `/admin`. `/agents` shows the available names. Routed envelopes include the available source context (`channel`, chat/thread/user/message IDs, original text, and timestamp) plus `selected_agent` so the target can reply through the correct channel.

Common commands:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/agents` | List allowed agent names. |
| `/admin <text>` | Route recovery or management text to the `admin` agent. |
| `/monitor <name> [lines]` | Show recent oh-my-code agent output, capped at 200 lines. |
| `/startagent <name>` | Start an oh-my-code agent; admin only. |
| `/stopagent <name>` | Stop an oh-my-code agent; admin only. |
| `/doctor` | Run oh-my-code diagnostics; admin only. |
| `/whoami` | Show channel identity values for allowlist setup. |
| `/ping` | Check channel responsiveness. |

`/tool` and `/tools` are intentionally unavailable in gateway mode.

## oh-my-code

The `ohMyCode` router invokes the agent-manager script in an existing oh-my-code workspace.

```yaml
agents:
  router: "ohMyCode"
  ohMyCode:
    enabled: true
    workspace: "/path/to/oh-my-code"
    agentManagerScript: ".claude/skills/agent-manager/scripts/main.py"
    defaultAgent: "qa-1"
    allowedAgents:
      - "qa-1"
      - "admin"
      - "coder-a"
    assignTimeoutSeconds: 90
```

The workspace requires Python, tmux, and agent-manager. If routed agents need to send channel replies, make the `use-fractalbot` skill available in that workspace.

## ChatGPT / Codex App

The `codexAppCDP` router delivers into a project conversation managed by the ChatGPT/Codex desktop app. The configuration key keeps its historical `codexAppCDP` name. Delivery first uses the running renderer's in-process `start-turn-for-host` bridge through CDP. If an upgraded App no longer exposes that handler, FractalBot uses a guarded visible-composer fallback in the exact resolved thread, protects an unrelated draft, and requires target-thread readback. It does not start a separate `codex app-server --listen` backend.

```yaml
agents:
  router: "codexAppCDP"
  codexAppCDP:
    enabled: true
    cdpEndpoint: "http://127.0.0.1:9222"
    targetSelector: "Codex"
    hostId: "local"
    targetProject:
      name: "CloudBank"
      cwd: "/Users/you/Develop/SuLabsOrg/CloudBank"
      session: "main"
    conversationId: ""
    inboxPath: "/Users/you/Develop/SuLabsOrg/CloudBank/.fractalbot/inbox"
    fallbackToInbox: true
    repairPolicy: "relaunch"
    checkOnIncomingMessage: true
    watch:
      enabled: true
      intervalSeconds: 60
      cooldownSeconds: 90
    defaultAgent: "main"
    allowedAgents:
      - "main"
    deliveryTimeoutSeconds: 20
```

Launch the installed desktop bundle with CDP enabled. Current releases use `ChatGPT.app`; older installations or local aliases may expose `Codex.app`.

```bash
open -na /Applications/ChatGPT.app --args --remote-debugging-port=9222
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:9222/json/version
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:9222/json/list
```

Prefer `targetProject.cwd` plus `targetProject.session` over a pinned `conversationId`. FractalBot resolves the current non-archived conversation before each delivery. A configured `conversationId` remains an explicit override.

Repair policies are `off`, `status-only`, `new-instance`, and `relaunch`. The default for an enabled route is `relaunch`, with the watchdog enabled. Set `status-only` when FractalBot should report readiness without controlling the app lifecycle.

When both direct bridge delivery and the guarded composer fallback fail, and `fallbackToInbox` is true, FractalBot atomically writes the normalized envelope to `inboxPath` for later consumption.

## Claude Desktop

The `claudeDesktop` router submits to an already authenticated Claude chat page exposed by CDP.

```yaml
agents:
  router: "claudeDesktop"
  claudeDesktop:
    enabled: true
    cdpEndpoint: "http://127.0.0.1:19334"
    targetSelector: ""
    inboxPath: "/Users/you/.fractalbot/claude-desktop-inbox"
    fallbackToInbox: true
    defaultAgent: "main"
    allowedAgents:
      - "main"
    deliveryTimeoutSeconds: 20
```

The selected CDP target must be a signed-in Claude chat, not a login page:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:19334/json/version
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:19334/json/list
```

FractalBot does not launch Claude Desktop, patch the application, bypass its CDP authentication guard, scrape chat history, or inject input through AppleScript. If the target is unavailable, logged out, lacks a compose box, or rejects submission, a configured fallback inbox receives the normalized envelope and delivery prompt with private file permissions.

## Grok Bot App

The `grokBotApp` router delivers into the signed-in Grok Bot desktop app (`Grok Bot.app`, bundle `com.anysphere.sand`). Inbox fallback is required when the router is enabled. CDP is optional and only used when you expose a DevTools endpoint yourself. `urlScheme` (`grokbot:` or `sand:`) is a best-effort open and is not treated as proof that the prompt was injected.

```yaml
agents:
  router: "grokBotApp"
  grokBotApp:
    enabled: true
    cdpEndpoint: "http://127.0.0.1:9222"
    targetSelector: "Grok Bot"
    urlScheme: "grokbot:"
    inboxPath: "/Users/you/.fractalbot/grok-bot-inbox"
    fallbackToInbox: true
    defaultAgent: "main"
    allowedAgents:
      - "main"
    deliveryTimeoutSeconds: 20
```

Do not enable `grokBotApp` by default on hosts that already use `ohMyCode`. FractalBot does not scrape Grok Bot history, read undocumented app tokens, patch the signed app, or brand an xAI HTTP API as `grokBotApp`.

If Grok Bot is running without CDP, inbound messages are queued to `inboxPath` with envelope-id / channel-chat-timestamp idempotency.

## Per-agent routers

`agents.agentRouters` maps one inbound agent name onto a runtime without changing the default `agents.router`. Channel allowlists include those mapped names, so `/agent trader` is accepted even when `ohMyCode.allowedAgents` does not list `trader`. If the mapped runtime is not enabled, delivery fails closed and does not fall through to oh-my-code tmux.

```yaml
agents:
  router: "ohMyCode"
  agentRouters:
    trader: grokBotApp
  grokBotApp:
    enabled: true
    targetSelector: "Trader Bot"
    urlScheme: "grokbot:"
    inboxPath: "/Users/you/.fractalbot/grok-bot-inbox"
    fallbackToInbox: true
    defaultAgent: "trader"
    allowedAgents:
      - "trader"
```

Do not point `grokBotApp.cdpEndpoint` at a Codex App CDP port. Grok Bot does not expose CDP by default.

## Observability

Use the status endpoint to inspect the selected router and most recent outcome:

```bash
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:18789/status | python3 -m json.tool
```

For desktop routes, `agents.last_routing` records the backend, status (`delivered`, `queued`, or `error`), selected agent, envelope ID, inbox path, and delivery error. The Codex App route also reports CDP readiness and the resolved project conversation. The Grok Bot App route additionally exposes `agents.grok_bot_app.inbox_path`, `last_routing`, and `last_error`.

See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) for startup and delivery failures.
